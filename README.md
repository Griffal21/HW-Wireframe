# HW-Wireframe
This is the HW for the first class
I don't think I positioned the boxes in the easiest way but it looks like the picure
I couldn't push or add the files through git bash.  I followed the directions and did the same procedures as the second day of class but nothing submitted.  I wound up doing it through the upload function instead.
